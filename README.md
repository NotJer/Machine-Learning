# An Overview of Machine Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains code and descriptions related to various machine learning concepts and algorithms. The code is adapted from several authoritative sources in the field of machine learning and deep learning.

## Sources

The code and descriptions are derived from the following books:
- **Deep Learning with Python** by Fran√ßois Chollet
- **Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective** by Stephen Marsland
- **A Hands-On Introduction to Machine Learning** by Chirag Shah
- **Machine Learning Refined** by Jeremy Watt, Reza Borhani, and Aggelos Katsaggelos
- **A Bayesian Tutorial (2E)** by D. S. Sivia with J. Skilling (ISBN 978-0-19-856832-2)

### Cross Entropy
Cross entropy is a loss function commonly used in classification problems. It measures the difference between two probability distributions - the true distribution and the predicted distribution.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of learning long-term dependencies. It is widely used in sequence prediction problems.

### Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression that models the relationship between two or more predictor variables and a response variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

### Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes independence between the features given the class label and is particularly effective for text classification tasks.

### Regularization
Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Common methods include L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, which add a penalty to the loss function based on the magnitude of the model coefficients.

### TensorFlow for Neural Networks
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It is widely used for building and training neural networks, including deep learning models.

### Agglomerative Clustering
Agglomerative clustering is a type of hierarchical clustering that builds nested clusters by repeatedly merging or splitting them. This technique starts with each data point as a single cluster and merges the closest pair of clusters until all points are in a single cluster or a specified number of clusters is reached. It is useful for discovering the underlying structure in data.

### Bayes Updating
Bayes updating is the process of adjusting the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or data becomes available. It uses Bayes' theorem to update the prior probability to a posterior probability. This method is foundational in Bayesian statistics and allows new data into existing models, making it effective for sequential analysis and decision-making under uncertainty.
